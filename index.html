 			Recent advancements in robotics, including autonomous vehicles e.g. UAVs, alongside edge and cloud computing, have paved the way for developing sophisticated robotic systems that harness these technologies.

			The RobotIc Systems in the Edge-Cloud Continuum (RISE) workshop brings together leading academics and industry professionals to explore how robotic systems can be designed, implemented, and optimized through the edge-cloud continuum. This workshop also focuses on how hyper-distributed applicationsâ€™ workloads and data that originate from robots and their sensors, should be processed and stored across devices, multiple edge computing layers, and centralized cloud resources.

			The RISE workshop is co-organized by the EMPYREAN project.

			We invite submissions of original research, work-in-progress, and proof-of-concept studies introducing novel ideas and innovative directions. We welcome submissions addressing the design, development, and evaluation of architectures, technologies, and applications for robots utilizing the edge-edge continuum, including but not limited to:

			Data processing and storage
			Distributed and collaborative robotics
			IoT, edge-cloud and robotics
			AI and machine learning for robotic operations
			Cybersecurity in edge-cloud and robotics
			Edge-cloud networking
			Autonomous system control and automation
			Digital twins for robotics
			Resource orchestration
			Processing of sensor data (e.g., LIDAR) within the continuum
			Use of hardware accelerators (GPU, DPU, FPGA)
			Robotic applications utilizing the continuum
